# The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming #

This is the sample code that accompanies the book
*The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths and Programming*
from the book's website
<https://homepages.cwi.nl/~jve/HR/>.  The repo may include other
little things that I scratched down also.  Note, the sample code
doesn't indicate which chapter it goes with, so I intend to add a
table of contents to this README.md, so I know which file goes with
which chapter at a glance.

- [Chapter 1: Getting Started](GS.hs)
- [Chapter 2: Talking about Mathematical Objects](TAMO.hs)
- [Chapter 3: The Use of Logic: Proof](TUOLP.hs)
